Code

To download AWS CLI:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install awscli


To set up/configure aws:

$ aws configure

It will ask for Access Key ID (in spreadsheet)
 Secret Access Key (in spreadsheet)
 Default region name (eu-west-2)
 Default output format (json)


To create a security group:

$ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name MySecurityGroup --description "My Security Group" --vpc-id vpc-dbd86eb2

The vpc-id is the Academy one, found on the instances page.
Once this command has run, it will give you the group-id of the security group (here it is sg-3c2b4755).


To add a rule to the security group:

$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-3c2b4755 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 164.39.75.108/24

The cidr is your public ip address found via eg. Whatsmyip.com, with /24 at the end because that's the rules!
To view the information contained in the security group:

$ aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-3c2b4755


To create a key pair:

$ aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name JessKeys --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > JessKeys.pem

This saves the key to a .pem file. To use the keys to SSH into an instance these keys are linked to you'll have to save it somewhere convenient and convert it to a .ppk file.
To give only yourself access:

$ sudo chmod 400 JessKeys.pem

To view the key pair info:

$ aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-name JessKeys

This will give you the key fingerprint and key name.


To create an instance using the secuirty group and key pair you just created:

$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-f1d7c395 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name JessKeys --security-group-ids sg-3c2b4755 --subnet-id subnet-7d578c06

The image-id is an ami number, which you can search for in the console or find via the "Launch Instance" page on ec2.
The subnet-id is the id of the subnet within the vpc group. This can be found through the console or on the "Instances" page on ec2.
Once this command has run, an instance within the vpc group will be initiallised and its information will be printed within the console.
You can SSH into this instance using PuTTY: The ip can be found via the console or from the "Instances" page on ec2, and the key pair will be the .ppk key you have saved in the convenient place ;).

Woo done!
