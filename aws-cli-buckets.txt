#Code to create a bucket in S3 using Windows CMD.

#First, aws cli needs to be downloaded and running on Windows.
#Download aws cli for Windows from the aws website. Run this executable file then start the CMD.
#To check it has installed properly, run:
aws --version

#Configure the aws cli as you would in Linux:
aws configure

#To create a bucket:
aws s3 mb s3://jessick

#This should output;
make_bucket: jessick

#To add a file to the bucket, navigate to the file directory, then run:
aws s3 cp aws-cli-walkthrough.txt s3://jessick/

#You can look in the bucket on s3 online to check that this has worked.

#As you can see, the commands we use to deal with files here are very similar/the same as those in Unix.
#Here are some other examples of commands and what they do:

#Move all .jpg files in s3://my-bucket/path to ./MyDirectory
aws s3 mv s3://my-bucket/path ./MyDirectory --exclude '*' --include '*.jpg' --recursive

#List the contents of my-bucket
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket

#List the contents of path in my-bucket
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/path

#Delete s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile.txt
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile.txt

#Delete s3://my-bucket/path and all of its contents
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/path --recursive
